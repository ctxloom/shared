// is the SETTINGS facet of an agent, deliberately separate from the launch
// facet (Backend) so a consumer — ltk, which only writes a hook — can depend on
// it without dragging in any launch/run machinery.
//
// NOTE (extraction): the config.* parameter types are ctxloom's normalized hook
// shape. When this package becomes github.com/ctxloom/agent those normalized
// types move here too (the UnifiedHooks contract), so the core owns the
// normalized form and each agent owns only the wire-format conversion.
