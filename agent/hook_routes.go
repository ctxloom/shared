// native event vocabulary, default matchers, and route order differ — so each
// declares its routes as data and RouteUnifiedHooks does the walk. Hooks that
// need per-agent special handling (e.g. antigravity's SessionStart context /
// PreToolUse-fallback diversion) are handled by the agent before routing and
// simply omitted from its route table.
