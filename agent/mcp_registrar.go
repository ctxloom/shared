// MCPRegistrar is the MCP-registration facet of an agent: where its MCP
// config lives per scope and how one named server is merged into / removed
// from its on-disk format. It is deliberately separate from SettingsWriter —
// the writer reconciles the ctxloom-managed server set against whole files,
// while a registrar gives an external tool (taskloom manage) byte-level,
// single-server registration that preserves every foreign entry.
//
// Each agent module exports its implementation; consumers hold a registry of
// these and never learn per-agent paths or formats.

	// Name is the agent identifier (e.g. "claude-code").

	// scope: its config file or well-known directory exists. Auto-registration

	// global (user-level, under the home dir) or project (under dir). Agents
	// without a usable scope return an error for it.

	// config). Idempotent; foreign keys and servers are preserved.

	// Uninstall removes the named server from the config bytes. Removing a
	// server that is not present is a no-op, not an error.
